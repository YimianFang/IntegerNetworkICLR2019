# IntegerNetworkICLR2019

Reproduction of "Integer Networks for Data Compression with Latent-Variable" for the hyperprior model "Variational image compression with a scale hyperprior", based on codes of [EccHui](https://github.com/EccHui/Integer-Hyper-prior-Network) and [liujiaheng](https://github.com/liujiaheng/compression).

Note that the performance on Kodak is poor.
